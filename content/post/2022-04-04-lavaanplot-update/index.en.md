My R package lavaanPlot has seen some updates since the last time I posted about it, and is now on version 0.6.3. 

Since last time I posted about it for [version 0.5.1](/post/lavaanplot-0-5-1/), I made some fixes/tweaks for existing features and added some new ones.

The most notable of these is that I added some new functions that allow one to save the `lavaanPlot` plots as images (png and pdf) to embed in rmarkdown docs.

I also updated the main vignette to show different diagrammeR layout options that one can use.

The package is on CRAN for [version 0.6.2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lavaanPlot), but more up to date versions of the package are on [github](https://github.com/alishinski/lavaanPlot).

The package now has it's own `pkgdown` website as well: [https://lavaanplot.alexlishinski.com](https://lavaanplot.alexlishinski.com).

I am planning more updates to the package soon to try and add some requested features.
